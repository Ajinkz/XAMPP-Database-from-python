# XAMPP-Database-from-python

# Hello to all , This repository is all about SQLAlchemy connection to a Xampp and Mysql server .
I created a student complain box in which we have to fill name,branch,phone number etc. after the submitting the data directly saved to the Mysql database.
While use this program in your computer make sure you have Xampp installed and on the server .
After that you have open the local host of server and make database and table .
Then go to the app.py and change the databse name in app.py and give the class name same as your table name
I hope it will help you a lot .
